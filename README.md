# Introduction
You’re the 12th chef of the month so far. The manager is an extreme micromanager constantly looking over your shoulder blasting you for every mistake you make. The work pressure is insane but the manager refuses to hire more than 1 chef at a time. It’s only a matter of time before he fires you too. How long can you last before getting fired?

Your goal is to complete as many orders as possible before getting fired. You have to keep track of the time limit of an order, make sure the food isn’t burning and make sure you’re making the burger exactly as the customer wants. Difficulty will increase as time goes on.

Controls:
- Check out the ‘How to play’ found on the main menu of the game for detailed instructions.
- Drag-and-drop to add/move ingredients.
- Press ESC to pause the game or close dialogue.
- In the settings you can change the game to easy mode. This is useful to get familiar with the game mechanics. In easy mode there are no timers and you can’t get fired.

The game became extremely click intensive, would have been nice if I had some time for some quality of life improvements. Also I should have made the grill smaller to reduce the mouse movement.

I’ve always made games in Java and this is my first time ever making a game in TypeScript. I tested the game in Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Please let me know if the game isn’t working for you.
